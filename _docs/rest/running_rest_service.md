title: Running the REST service

With the project opened in NetBeans, in the menu on the left, please expand the **Project Files** tree. There are more files in that folder, but the interesting one is `pom.xml`. Please open this `pom.xml` by double cliking it. This file does not belong to Java itself, but is part of [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Apache Maven is a  software project management and comprehension tool. Simply put, it will **build the project** for you. And then **run it** for you, if you wish. And yes, we would like to tell Maven to run the project for us.

## Current status explanation

In the project generated by NetBeans, Maven is fully configured to build the project. But not to run in, since there are countless options how to run the application. 

- Running the application in a microcontainer
- Creating a hollow jar
- Deployment into an application server

and many others. **Java EE is about freedom** and no strategy how to run your application is enforced. This guide will show **one quick and trouble-free** option how to run it. Other options will be further explained in advanced guides.

As you can see in the `pom.xml`, the application has just one dependency, and the dependency is `javaee-web-api`. Nothing more. The dependency is `provided`, which means it is provided by the runtime (application server, microcontainer, anything ...) and you do not have to worry about what needs to be packed with the application. This makes the application extremely small (few kilobytes). Overall, Java EE applications are small in size and quick to run.

## The final countdown

To run the project, let's just add few lines into the `pom.xml` and then make Apache Maven run it. Our application will run on [WildFly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io/), which is one of the many choices on Java EE. WildFly Swarm is a very advanced solution in terms of user convenience and overall usability.

Just add WildFly Swarm to the `pom.xml` root.

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
            <artifactId>bom-all</artifactId>
            <version>2017.5.0</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Finally, add the **WildFly Swarm** plugin into the `<build> .. <plugins>` section of the `pom.xml`.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2017.5.0</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>package</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

### The final look of pom.xml
The whole `pom.xml` after the WildFly Swarm was added should not look like this:

## Execute the running command

In NetBeans, right click on the project name in the menu on the left. In the pop-up menu, choose **Run Maven** -> **Goals**. A pop-up window will appear. In this window, leave everything as-is and into the `goals` field, type `wildfly-swarm:run` and **hit the OK** button.

</a> 

Now `the service started`. Great ! The startup time is usually under 1 second, but not the first time. For the first time, the WildFly Swarm must be downloaded. Only few megabytes are downloaded and the length of the process depends on your connection speed. Once the application starts, you will see `WildFly Swarm is Ready` in the output console in NetBeans. Wildfly Swarm is clever and will only download the parts required. You do not need to specify those party anywhere, it will automatically guess the configuration.



### Query the service
Open just about any browser and type `http://localhost:8080/messages/hello` as an URL. You should see  `Hello, RESTful world !` message sent from the server. And there is nothing more to it. With this configuration, you can start creating production-ready applications. If you add more of Java EE to your application, WildFly swarm will just download what is needed during the run process. You do not have to care about anything.
