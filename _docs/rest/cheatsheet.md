The preparation phase is very easy. There are only two things required.

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - NetBeans

Java Development Kit **makes it possible** to build Java applications. Period. It is required to build any Java application in general, not only Java EE applications. And because Java EE applications are written in Java, the same tools are used for building it.

The IDE **makes it easy** for the developer to create Java EE projects by providing syntax highligting, code completion any countless other features. For Java EE, the first choice is [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/). A project once started in the heart of Europe as a student project is now top-class IDE, offering great Java EE support. And it is available for everyone to use for free.


## Download
There are two alternatives. If you are a comlete beginner, just download the whole package. If you are a Java developer or there is simply an up-to-date Java Development Kit already present on your system, there is always the option to download both parts separately. If you do not know what to do, just download the whole package.

### Downloading the whole package

If you do not own JDK, nor IDE, you can always **[download the latest version of both in one bundle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html)**.

### Alternative: one-by-one download

If you already have the Java Development Kit, only the IDE can be downloaded. Or, you want to have precise control over the JDK installed, both parts can be downloaded separately.

- Download [latest Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and install it.
- After installation of the JDK, [download latest](https://netbeans.org/downloads/) Java EE version of NetBeans and install it as well.

## NetBeans installation

### Windows
Piece of cake. Just double-click the installer ! C'mon, you can do it :) Leave everything to default, only pick the path where you want your NetBeans installed.

### Linux
In terminal, go to the folder where netbeans-{version}.sh is downloaded and type `chmod +x netbeans-{version}.sh`. This marks the installer as executable. Then, execute it by simply typing `./netbeans-{version}.sh`.

Leave everything to default, only pick the path where you want your NetBeans installed.


## Finish

And **you are done**. Run NetBeans IDE and feel free to go to the next chapter, where **coding starts**.
