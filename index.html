              <p class="lead">"The Chinese Emperor’s Hindustan Jades” integrates text analysis, mapping,
              and interactive image viewers to visualize eighteenth-century China’s 
			  engagement with the Islamic world.This project is led by Dr. Kristina Kleutghen 
			  at the Digital Humanities Workshop at Washington University in St. Louis.
             This project is built on two major types of datasets - textual and the image/objects.
             The textual dataset is composed of approximately one hundred poems that the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-1795) wrote
			 and ordered incised onto the Islamic jades in his collection and separately published texts in the 'Imperial Poems' 御製詩. 
			 The image/object dataset is the group of extant inscribed jades from primarily the 17th-mid 18th century, which this project aims to map across
             geographic space and time. This website will eventually hold texts and static images for the entire
             'Hindustan' collection, along with links to a IIF server for close analysis and a
             collated heat map for the entirety of the collection.</p>
